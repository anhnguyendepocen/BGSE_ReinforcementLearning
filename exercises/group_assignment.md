# Group projects

The main goal of the project is to get hands-on experience with reinforcement learning. You will work in groups of three people maximum, feel free to form these groups yourself. If majority prefers that we randomly form the groups, let us know.

You can choose one of the following types of projects:  

1. Take a recent reinforcement learning paper that you find interesting and reproduce the results. You should implement the algorithms yourself rather than simply using existing library. Be careful not to choose a paper that would be too simple or one that would be computationally too costly (e.g. don't try to reproduce AlphaZero). Select several candidates and send it to us for an approval.  

2. Take some classical problems from the RL literature (e.g. cart pole balancing, mountain car or pendulum) and implement several candidate algorithms in attempt to solve the problem. For RL you can use environments from existing libraries (e.g. OpenAI gym), but you should implement the algorithms yourself.

3. You can also find a (new) real-world application of bandit/RL algorithms and develop the code illustrating the application. You should be careful here with going with the full RL treatment, as it might be very difficult to get it to work. Bandit and contextual bandit applications are more straightforward. If you opt for this talk to us. 

4. Literature review. You can also read a bunch of papers on a particular topic in bandit/RL literature and write a small review paper. Let us know if you want an inspiration for a topic you could focus on.


The work does not need to be original, feel free to replicate a reinforcement learning paper that you find interesting. We are fine with that, as long as you get some hands-on experience. Be careful with the underlying model that you will be optimizing and amount of data, no need to have a very costly problem that would take you a very long time to optimize.

To complete the assignment you should do the following:  

1. Write a brief report where you will present your findings. Report can be anything - a document, slides, webpage or an R/Jupyter notebook. No need to write too much, but do not put only the results - describe what you are doing and interpret the results. In case you opted for a literature review it needs to be a longer report (max 6000 words), taking a usual form of a scientific review article. 
2. Unless you are doing the literature review, we will expect some code. We should be able to redo your analysis ideally with a single line command. It can be implemented in any language, though, we do have a preference for R and Python. We value well organized, readable code with some basic documentation. Feel free to use existing libraries.  

Deadline is **June 20, 23:59**. Submit it by email to Gergely and Hrvoje.
