## Overview and Objectives

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a model-based theory of sequential decision-making under uncertainty. It is currently a dominant theoretical framework for understanding and building autonomous agents that can learn and act in the environment on their own. The objective of this course is to introduce students to the main challenges and techniques of modern RL, particularly focusing on computational aspects of dealing with the dynamic nature of the RL problem, and on the statistical challenges posed by the uncertainty of the environment. On both fronts, the goal is to provide a strong understanding of the most common methods and provide a basic algorithmic toolbox for building RL systems. The course puts a strong emphasis on crucial challenges that set RL problems apart from other machine learning problems. Students taking the course are expected to gain the capability to identify and tackle such challenges in various application domains. Various applications relevant to Data Science will be highlighted throughout the course.

## Required Activities

Attendance to classes, completing 5 individual problem sets and a group-based final project.     


## Evaluation criteria

Problem sets account for 50% of the final grade, while the remaining 50% comes from a final project. The problem sets are carried out by each student individually, whereas the final project in teams of up to three students.


## Competences          

Construct a global vision of the situation of the problem based on knowledge of the synergies between advanced statistical methods, computing and business analysis to generate added value.

Modeling and predicting high-dimensional data with advanced statistical methods in the field of data science in order to improve strategic decision making.

Apply the knowledge of programming languages, computer programs and advanced services in the Cloud to solve the problems that are presented to the data scientist.

Solve the real problems that arise in the fields of study through the accurate analysis of the data.

Communicate with conviction in English the results and implications of the required analytical study using a language related to the receiver.

Work in a heterogeneous team of researchers in the field of the economic analyst using specific group techniques.

Own and understand knowledge that provides a basis or opportunity to be original in the development and / or application of ideas, often in a research context.

That students know how to apply the acquired knowledge and their ability to solve problems in new or unfamiliar environments within broader (or multidisciplinary) contexts related to their area of study.

That the students be able to integrate knowledge and face the complexity of making judgments based on information that, being incomplete or limited, include reflections on the social and ethical responsibilities linked to the application of their knowledge and judgments.

That the students know to communicate their conclusions and the knowledge and last reasons that sustain them to specialized and non-specialized publics in a clear and unambiguous way.

That students have the learning skills that allow them to continue studying in a way that will be largely self-directed or autonomous.
